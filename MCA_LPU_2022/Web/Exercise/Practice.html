        As the field of 
communication systems advances, the number of interconnected mobile devices is 
increasing compared to fixed desktop devices. Internet of Things technologies play a key 
role in digital transformation. Internet protocols and their applications in everyday 
life play a major role in networks. These lightweight devices can easily connect to the 
Internet, but the main issues lie in the areas of processing power, storage capacity,
 and security. Although processing and storage limitations can be overcome with cloud 
 computing, the security of these lightweight devices, commonly known as the Internet of
  Things, is a common concern for researchers, network security groups, governments,
   law enforcement, and consumers. IoT security is an area dedicated to protecting 
   connected devices and IoT networks</span></p>

        In particular, IOT is the addition of internet connectivity to lightweight digital machines, objects, and creatures (humans and animals). Things on the network are identified by unique identifiers. Because IoT is a broad field, IoT security techniques and strategies are even more extensive. For this reason, different methods are applied to IoT security. Generally, IOT devices have a large attack surface due to involvement of heterogenous technologies in IOT system so it gives hackers opportunity to interact with IOT devices remotely. Thatâ€™s why hacking like phishing, snipping is effective. This area includes application programming interface security, commonly known as API security, public key infrastructure, commonly known as PKI authentication and network security, wireless network security, and key generation and encryption for network security algorithms. IoT security addresses a variety of techniques, strategies, protocols, and countermeasures required to mitigate IoT vulnerabilities in modern systems. Attacks against these lightweight devices can result in enormous loss of life, financial systems, businesses and consumers. Every day, security experts discover new malware targeting IoT devices that are vulnerable to attacks due to poor security protocols. This chapter describes what is IOT security, what is IOT privacy, IOT security protocols and their uses and limitations. What are security risks and risk-avoidance techniques? We also discuss privacy issues and real-world examples of security breaches in IoT devices.
